/* The following class is used to adjust the styling of tables that are styled in Bootstrap.
The problem with the Bootstrap tables was that they shifted around when buttons disappeared
(for example, after you hit the book button). */

/* Fix the layout so that changes to contents of row make the size of the rows jump */
.bootstrapAdjustTable{
    width: 100%;
    table-layout: fixed;
}

/* Our desk table currently has three fields that we would like to each occupy a third
of the space */
.bootstrapAdjustTable tr td{
    /*width: 33%;*/
    /*text-align: center;*/
}

/* Fix the height so that changes to the contents of the cells (button added, loading icon
shown, loading icon removed) do not make the height of the cells jump up and down */
.bootstrapAdjustTable tr {
    height: 50px;
}

/* Give the headings of the columns the same height for consistency. The height is chosen
 as it is slightly bigger than the bootstrap button, so it does not jump when it appears or
 disappears */
.bootstrapAdjustTable tr th{
    height: 50px;
    /*text-align: center;*/
}
